## HashSets
- A HashSet is a collection of items where each item is unique.
- The HashSet class is part of the java.util package.
- The HashSet class is similar to the ArrayList class, but with some differences.
- The HashSet class is not synchronized, which means it is not thread-safe.
- HashSet stores its elements in a hash table.
- HashSet is the best performing set implementation.
