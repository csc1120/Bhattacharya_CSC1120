# Algorithm Time Complexity
## 1. Introduction
- Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input.
- It is a way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
- It is often expressed using big O notation.

## 2. Big O Notation
- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
- It is used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm.
- It is often used to describe the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm.
- For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n) has a worst-case time complexity that grows linearly with the size of the input.
- Common time complexities include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(n!).
